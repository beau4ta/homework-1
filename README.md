# I have changed some tags to make the site more accessible.
# "header" "main" "aside" "footer"

# I have consolidated space in the CSS file by taking classes with identical attributes and condensing them into one tag.

# I have made comments on the CSS in order to explain the processes.

# I have fixed broken links.

# I changed the title of the page to Horiseon instead of website.

# I gave the images alt tags.

# I couldn't find how to screenshot the whole image so i took multiple screenshots that go together.
